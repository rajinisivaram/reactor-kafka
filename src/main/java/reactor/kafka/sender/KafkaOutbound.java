/**
 * {@link KafkaOutbound} is a reactive gateway for outgoing data flows to Kafka. Each KafkaOutbound
 * represents a sequence of outgoing records that are sent to Kafka using {@link KafkaOutbound#send(Publisher)}.
 * Send sequences may be chained together into a longer sequence of outgoing producer records.
 * Like {@link Flux} and {@link Mono}, subscribing to the tail {@link KafkaOutbound} schedules all
 * parent sends in the declaration order. Outgoing records of each topic partition will be delivered
 * to Kafka in the declaration order.
 * <p>
 * The subscriber to KafkaOutbound is notified of completion and failure of its send sequence. If any
 * record cannot be delivered to Kafka, the outbound publisher fails with an error. Note that some
 * of the subsequent records already in flight may still be delivered. If {@link SenderOptions#stopOnError()}
 * is false, sends of all records will be attempted before the sequence is failed. No metadata is returned
 * for individual records on success or failure. {@link KafkaSender#send(Publisher, boolean)} may be used
 * to send records to Kafka when per-record completion status is required.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     sender.createOutbound()
 *       .send(flux1)
 *       .send(flux2)
 *       .send(flux3)
 *       .subscribe();
 * }
